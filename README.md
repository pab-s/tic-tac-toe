# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Vanilla JavaScript tic tac toe game where you play against the computer and choose whether to play as X or O.
This was one the first JavaScript app I did so is not super clean and functional code, but I was happy at the time I did it.
I will probably come back and try to clean up the code and logic later.
